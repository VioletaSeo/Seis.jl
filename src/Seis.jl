# `Seis` â€“ Passive seismology in Julia

## Types

Seis exports three important types:

- `Event`, which holds information about a seismic event;
- `Station`, holding information about a seismic station or channel; and
- `Trace`, which combines the above two with a time series.

In each case, the user is allowed to access some of the fields, because
`getproperty` and `setproperty!` are defined for arrays of these types.
Operating on arrays of `Trace`s is the fundamental design of Seis and offers
the greatest flexibility in dealing with seismic data, including using Julia's
broadcasting on these types with the methods defined here.
