# Seis.jl

Seis.jl is an open, fast and flexible framework for analysing seismic
data in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

Right now we are asking the passive seismic community what they want in a
package; see the [draft specification document](https://github.com/anowacki/Seis.jl/blob/master/Seis.jl.md) for
more detail.
